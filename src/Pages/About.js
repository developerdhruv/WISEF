        <h2>Problem</h2>
        <p>
        In contemporary society, ensuring the safety and well-being of women
        remains a critical concern. Despite various initiatives and advancements,
        instances of discomfort, harassment, or unsafe situations persist, posing a
        continuous threat to women's security. Existing solutions often lack a realtime, community-driven approach to address these issues effectively.
        The need for an innovative solution arises from the absence of a
        comprehensive platform where women feeling uneasy or threatened can
        instantly seek help from nearby individuals registered on the application.
        Existing safety applications may not fully harness the potential of crowdsourcing, thus leaving a critical gap in providing timely and localized
        assistance.

        <h2>Outcomes</h2>
        <p>
        ➢ Women can get help in less margin of time
        ➢ Women can feel safe
        ➢ Builds a unity and a powerful helping community
        ➢ Decrease in crimes that cause because of late response
